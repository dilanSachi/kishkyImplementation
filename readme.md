One natural extension of this work is to further investigate
weighting schemes.As seen in our results, choosing a properweight- ing scheme can significantly improve the performance of down- stream document alignment. Another area of investigation is in better cross-lingual representations. Finally, a supervised model might better guide the cross-lingual alignment process than the unsupervised distance metric used here. Several approaches could be investigated to incorporate supervision including metric learning and directly learning document represen- tations to discern cross-lingual documents.
